Network Security Labs
This repository will house different Network Security labs I did while in Network Security, IT 430
These labs were conducted in a home lab consisting of my laptop, Virtual Box, and four VMs, including Kali Linux, Windows XP, Windows Server 2016, and Windows 7
Documentation of observations noted will mostly be included along with screenshots, and databases where applicable
